This repo is still work in progress...

Some features to implement:
1) Ability to give multiple custom tags to points in a pointcloud, and access only the points with a specific tag (eg, corner, surface1, surface2, etc.)
2) No need to have a separate copy of original cloud and the filtered cloud just add a tag for example 'sor_filtered' to the filtered points in the existing cloud and get it easily when needed.
3) ROS1, ROS2 support.
4) Functions for popular feature extraction and matching algorithms.
5) Visualization?
